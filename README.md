# Water_Billing_Management_System
WBMS (Water Billing Management System) is a project which is the best alternative and improvement to most water boards especially to enable the association to acquire better management in water billing. The system will have authorized user accounts and features that can accomplish transactions such as creating paper and paperless billing that includes water meter reading and monthly collection. Most problems, currently seen, result from the manual processes followed as calculation errors, delays in system updating and bill sending, also application tracking issues are the major problems that water boards find difficult to find answers for. The authorized user shall update monthly water meter reading each resident’s water consumption and monitor possible unpaid water bills or monthly collection. Monthly water bills will be computed according to water meter consumption rates along with the monthly dues. The customers can register for new water connection and can check the status of the new connection application which will be forwarded to the approval team on admin side. Authorized users will be able to manage customer or resident’s list. Records will include the owner’s full name, email address or mobile number, resident’s block, monthly water meter consumption including previous reading and current reading, and monthly dues.
